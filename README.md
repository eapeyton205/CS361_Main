### Managing Your List

- **Mark as read**: Click the checkmark icon to move books to your reading history
- **Remove books**: Click the trash icon to delete books from your list

### Reading History

## How It Works

BookBase uses smart series tracking to ensure you never get spoilers:
- Books are organized by series automatically
- Suggestions only include books where you've read all previous books in the series
- Standalone books are always available for suggestions

## Data Storage

Your reading data is stored locally in JSON files:
- `books.json` - Your TBR list
- `read_books.json` - Your reading history

These files are automatically created when you first use the app.

## Technology Stack

- **Streamlit** - Web application framework
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **JSON** - Local data storage
